# AI-Assisted Detection of Lung Cancer in Chest CT Scans Using Deep Learning
This project implements a deep learning model for the multi-class classification of chest CT scan images. The model is trained to distinguish between:
- Normal (No Cancer)
- Adenocarcinoma
- Large-Cell Carcinoma
- Squamous Cell Carcinoma

The aim is to explore how artificial intelligence can support early detection and differentiation of lung cancer subtypes, which is crucial for guiding treatment strategies. The system uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with transfer learning to achieve robust performance on a relatively small dataset.
